# An example To-Do List app written in a PHP framework that does not exist

If there was a PHP framework called **Unicorn** designed specifically for me, this is what a to-do list app would look like. If it looks suspiciously similar to Java's Spring MVC, it is not a coincidence.

The **unicorn/framework** composer package, as well as all the classes in the **Unicorn** namespace, do not actually exist. This project cannot be built or run. It is purely made for browsing the source code.
